## Setup

Before running ```npm start``` or ```npm test``` you need to set your Telegram API key in the .env file.  
- Run ```npm setup```
- Open ```.env``` and paste your API key

In order to make the /[restaurant] command work, you need to grab them from
their webpages first. Put the required data in the `lib/data.json` file and
take a look at `lib/menu.sample.js` to see how to download the menu cards.
